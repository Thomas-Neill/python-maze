# python-maze

This is a small repository with maze generators and solvers.

I made this a while ago, and the solver was unusable. I rewrote it.

The generators were similarly atrocious, demonstrating a similar ineptitude. They've been rewritten with help from some of Jamis Buck's excellent articles.
